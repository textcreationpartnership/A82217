         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165066:3"/>of the Mariners, a great diſtraction would ſuddenly break forth amongſt them new Coles being already kindling, which are ready to break forth in a viſible flame.</p>
            <p>For we hear, that they mutiny exceedingly, and have declared, That they will not engage againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Navy without aſſurance both of preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſatisfaction; inſomuch, that many of them have undantedly remonſtrated to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and other ſuperiour Officers, that they will rather die and ſuffer martyrdome, then be enſlaved and ruled by a uſurping power and arbytrary Government.</p>
            <p>This ſtrange allarum ſoundeth in the eares of many like a terrible eccho, and puts a great demur to the proceedings at Court, many of the Grandees declining Engagement; eſpecially ſince the receipt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the parliaments Navy are put forth to Sea who are joyntly reſolved to hazard the encounter, and to bring them to obedience and ſubjection, who have perfidiouſly deſerted, and betrayed the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them.</p>
            <p>And by an Expreſſe from <hi>Helver-ſluce</hi> it is further intimated, that upon the lanching forth of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhips to the Ocean, they ſoon eſpyed a Squadron of the princes Fleet, all under ſayl, being about ſixteen in number, who making towards them, and comming within ſhot, gave them a broad ſide, which by reaſon of a ſecond Volley from the aſſaulted, a hot conflict began, being diſputed with great reſoluteneſſe and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry on both ſides, the Victory ſeeming a long while doubtfull, but at laſt it fell to the parliamenteers, who ſunk one of their Combitants, chaſed the reſt many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165066:3"/>leagues, and are now become Maſters of a great part of the Britiſh Seas.</p>
            <p>This is reported here with great confidence, and it is verily believed, the reſt will not ſtand a fight, divers of them fearing, that they ſhall be made exemplary, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be taken. Col. <hi>Popham</hi> one of the parliaments Admirals, hath cleered the Weſtern Coaſt neere the Iſle of <hi>Portland,</hi> and forced many to fly before him. The other two Admirals, Col. <hi>Blague,</hi> and Col. <hi>Deane,</hi> are upon the ſame motion on the South weſt point.</p>
